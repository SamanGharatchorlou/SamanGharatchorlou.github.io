	  	<h4>About</h4>
	  	<p>Welcome to my website! There are two games on here RISK, based on the original board game and a Tower Defence game. With a third game in development, which is a 1st Person Shooter. I developed all the games on the Unity Game Engine with C# and the website on HTML and CSS. There’ll be links to the source code if you’re interested. </p>
		<p>All the games are still in some form of development as I’ll updating them as time goes on. Considering this there may still be some bugs, if you find one please let me know, you'll know a bug if the game breaks...hopefully you won’t find any of those slimy critters. These games haven't been tried and tested by many people so any feedback you have on the games is welcomed. If you click on the <i>More Detail</i> tabs I go over the improvements I have planned for the game. </p>
		<p>Anyway enough chat, go checkout my games!</p>

					<h4>Aim</h4>
				  	<p>Take control of the whole map by taking out the other teams. Strategically build up your armies and try to hold continents to increase the number of soldiers you receive at the start of your turn. This game can be played with 2-4 computer players.</p>

					<b>Developing This Game</b>
				  	<p>This was my first big project, it was a challenge not just building the core game itself but also creating computer players (referred to AI, even though it’s not really AI). For the AI I had to build a complex string of recursive functions (a function that calls itself), which was quite a challenge, particularly for the attack phase. The AI works on a set of basic rules that it follows giving the impression it knows (well sort of) what it’s doing.</p>
					<b>Further Developments</b>
				  	<p>I 'completed' this game about a month before I completed it because I was constantly adding little features here and there. There's still a tonne of stuff I want to add, but haven’t got around to yet, a few of them below:</p>
				  	<ul>
				  		<li>Graphics</br>
						The game currently consists of boxes fighting eachother, which is kind of dull. I want to add actual soldiers with fighting, killing and dying animations to give the game more life.</li>
						<li>Improved Computer Player</br>
						As mentioned the current AI works on a few basic rules. I'm hoping to make the AI a little more situational so it can make some more complex decisions being more unpredictable.</li>
						<li>Prediction Algorithm</br>
						To do the above I need to build a prediction algorithm to calculate win/loss probabilities of certain battle situations and I'd like to add something into the game giving the player the ability to calculate the chance of winning a fight, maybe once a turn or trade a soldier for 10 uses etc. I figured out equations to calculate 1v1, 1v2, 2v1 and 2v2 battles already. I haven’t been able to calculate the probability for 3v2 battle yet, I know what probabilities are but not the equation (not that you need it once you have the probabilities). If you know how to do it, let me know.</li>
						<li>Dice Roll</br>
						Ross wants to see what he has rolled so I'll add some dice animations.</li>
				  	</ul>
				  	<p>There are even more things I want to add like a death laser, but I’ll stop here before I get too carried away.</p>

					<h4>Aim</h4>
				 	<p>Stop the creeps from reaching your base! Creeps will follow the path around the map making their way to your base, where they are trying to steal your stuff, sneaky creeps. Build towers on the tiles to shoot them down before they reach the end. Warning its quite hard, so be prepared.</p>

					<b>Developing This Game</b>
				  	<p>This was one of the first games I ever made, definitely a learning project and a relatively simple and basic game.</p>
				  	<b>Further Developments</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Target Lock</br>
						Currently the towers shoot at their closest target, this obviously changes rapidly as the creeps move across the map causing the towers to flicker across targets rapidly. I will change this so that the towers target the creep closest to the players base within their range, a more conventional (and better) way to do it I think.</li>
						<li>Tower Types</br>
						Currently there are 6 waves and 2 tower types each with an upgrade option, 2 enemy types and a boss. I'd like to expand the tower types, including: a short range, rapid fire tower; a slow fire, splash damage tower and a low damage, slowing tower. Expanding the upgrade options so you have multiple options each having various benefits would be an even further development.</li>
						<li>Enemy Types</br>
						I'll look to expand the enemy rooster eventually, but that'll come last. For now, I'll just tweak them to keep the game balanced.</li>
						<li>More Waves!</br>
						Before I add more tower and enemy types I think we want more enemy waves to get the game going a bit more.</li>

				  	<p>I started making a 1st person shooter a while ago and dropped it for some reason. Right now, its playable, but as basic as a game gets. I'll develop this game further before I put it on my site.</br>
					I want to make a fun, easy(ish) to play, fast paced game. If you have any good ideas drop me a message. I don’t have any feedback forms yet (in development) so drop me an email at <i>samangharat@gmail.com</i>, I'd genuinely like to hear your ideas. Thanks!</p>
